An experimental (yet stable) Node.js driver for RethinkDB with promises and a connection pool.

_Note_: To use `yield` as shown in the examples, you have to start `node` unstable (>= 0.11) with
the `--harmony` flag.


### Quick start ###
-------------

Example wih [koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa):

```js
var app = require('koa')();
var r = require('rethinkdbdash')();

app.use(function *(){
    var result = yield r.table("foo").get("bar").run();

    this.body = JSON.stringify(result);
});

app.listen(3000);
```

Example with [bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird):

```js
var Promise = require('bluebird');
var r = require('rethinkdbdash')();

var run = Promise.coroutine(function* () {
    var result

    try{
        result = yield r.table("foo").get("bar").run();
        console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
    }
    catch(e) {
        console.log(e);
    }
})();
```

Note: You have to start node with the `--harmony` flag.


### Install ###
-------------

```
npm install rethinkdbdash
```

The `rethinkdbdash-unstable` package is a relic from the past when the driver had a dependency on `node-protobuf`.


### Documentation ###
-------------
While rethinkdbdash uses almost the same syntax as the official driver, there are still
a few differences.

This section references all the differences. For all the other methods not
mentionned here, please refer to the
[official driver's documentation](http://www.rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/).



The differences are:

#### Module name ####

Import rethinkdbdash:
```js
var r = require('rethinkdbdash')(options);
```

`options` can be:
- `{pool: false}` -- if you do not want to use a connection pool.
- the options for the connection pool, which can be:

```js
{
    min: <number>, // minimum number of connections in the pool, default 50
    max: <number>, // maximum number of connections in the pool, default 1000
    bufferSize: <number>, // minimum number of connections available in the pool, default 50
    timeoutError: <number>, // wait time before reconnecting in case of an error (in ms), default 1000
    timeoutGb: <number>, // how long the pool keep a connection that hasn't been used (in ms), default 60*60*1000
    maxExponent: <number>, // the maximum timeout before trying to reconnect is 2^maxExponent*timeoutError, default 6 (~60 seconds for the longest wait)
    silent: <boolean> // console.error errors (default false)
}
```


#### Promises ####

Rethinkdbdash uses promises and not callback.
RethinkDB >= 1.13 handles both syntaxes.

Example 1 with `yield`:
```js
try{
    var cursor = yield r.table("foo").run();
    var result = yield cursor.toArray();
    //process(result);
}
else {
    console.log(e.message);
}
```

Example 2 with `yield`:
```js
try{
    var cursor = yield r.table("foo").run();
    var row;
    while(cursor.hasNext()) {
        row = yield cursor.next();
        //process(row);
    }
}
else {
    console.log(e.message);
}
```

Example with `then` and `error`:
```js
r.table("foo").run().then(function(connection) {
    //...
}).error(function(e) {
    console.log(e.mssage)
})
```


#### Connection pool ####

Rethinkdbdash implements a connection pool and is created by default.

If you do not want to use a connection pool, iniitialize rethinkdbdash with `{pool: false}` like this:
```js
var r = require('rethinkdbdash')({pool: false});
```

You can provide options for the connection pool with the following syntax:
```js
var r = require('rethinkdbdash')({
    min: <number>, // minimum number of connections in the pool, default 50
    max: <number>, // maximum number of connections in the pool, default 1000
    bufferSize: <number>, // minimum number of connections available in the pool, default 50
    timeoutError: <number>, // wait time before reconnecting in case of an error (in ms), default 1000
    timeoutGb: <number>, // how long the pool keep a connection that hasn't been used (in ms), default 60*60*1000
    maxExponent: <number>, // the maximum timeout before trying to reconnect is 2^maxExponent*timeoutError, default 6 (~60 seconds for the longest wait)
    silent: <boolean> // console.error errors (default false)
});

try {
    var cursor = yield r.table("foo").run();
    var result = yield cursor.toArray(); // The connection used in the cursor will be released when all the data will be retrieved
}
catch(e) {
    console.log(e.message);
}
```

Get the number of connections
```js
r.getPool().getLength();
```

Get the number of available connections
```js
r.getPool().getAvailableLength();
```

Drain the pool
```js
r.getPool().drain();
```


The pool can emits emits:
- `draining`: when `drain` is called
- `queueing`: when a query is added/removed from the queue (queries waiting for a connection), the size of the queue is provided
- `size`: when the number of connections changes, the number of connections is provided
- `available-size`: when the number of available connections changes, the number of available connections is provided

__Note__: If a query returns a cursor, the connection will not be released as long as the
cursor hasn't fetched everything or has been closed.


#### Cursor ####

Rethinkdbdash does not extend `Array` with methods and returns a cursor as long as your
result is a sequence.

```js
var cursor = yield r.expr([1, 2, 3]).run()
console.log(JSON.stringify(cursor)) // does *not* print [1, 2, 3]

var result = yield cursor.toArray();
console.log(JSON.stringify(result)) // print [1, 2, 3]
```


#### Errors ####
- Better backtraces

Long backtraces are split on multiple lines.  
In case the driver cannot serialize the query, it provides a better location of the error.

- Arity errors

The server may return confusing error messages when the wrong number
of arguments is provided (See [issue 2463](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2463) to track progress).
Rethinkdbdash tries to make up for it by catching errors before sending
the query to the server if possible.


#### Miscellaneous ####


- Maximum nesting depth

The maximum nesting depth is your documents is by default 100 (instead of 20).
You can change this setting with

```js
r.setNestingLevel(<number>)
```

- Performance

The tree representation of the query is built step by step and stored which avoid
recomputing it if the query is re-run.  

- Connection

If you do not wish to use rethinkdbdash connection pool, you can implement yours. The
connections created with rethinkdbdash emits a "release" event when they receive an
error, an atom, or the end (or full) sequence.

A connection can also emit a "timeout" event if the underlying connection times out.

- `undefined` values in an object

Rethinkdbdash will ignore the keys/values where the value is `undefined`.

### Run tests ###
-------------

Update `test/config.js` if your RethinkDB instance doesn't run on the default parameters.

Run
```
mocha --harmony-generators
```
